# Heart Disease Prediction Model

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health factors. The prediction model is built using logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm.

### Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pip package manager
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter notebook)
Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

  pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/username/heart-related.git
Navigate to the project directory:
  cd heart-disease-prediction
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to see the prediction model in action.
### Usage

Jupyter Notebook: Open heart_disease_prediction.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to see the step-by-step process of building and evaluating the prediction model.
Python Script: Alternatively, you can run heart_disease_prediction.py using Python:
  python heart_disease_prediction.py
This will execute the script and display the prediction results.

### Data

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [heart.csv] and contains various health-related attributes.
